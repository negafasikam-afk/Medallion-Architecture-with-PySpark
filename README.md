# Medallion-Architecture-with-PySpark
Implemented a Medallion Architecture on Microsoft Fabric using PySpark for retail data. Raw data was ingested into the Bronze layer, cleaned and deduplicated in Silver, and transformed into a Gold star schema with Date, Customer, Product dimensions and a Sales fact table, based on a DP-700 course activity.
